🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Road Accident Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI.
The goal of the project is to analyze accident data to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to road accidents.
The dashboard provides interactive visualizations for better decision-making and road safety improvements.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the distribution of accidents by time, location, and severity.

Identify accident hotspots and peak accident hours.

Analyze the impact of road conditions, weather, and vehicle type on accidents.

Provide an interactive dashboard to explore accident trends and insights.

📊 Features of Dashboard

Total number of accidents and casualties (KPIs).

Breakdown of accidents by day, month, and year.

Accident severity distribution (Fatal, Serious, Slight).

Accident hotspots (map visualization).

Impact of weather, road type, and time of day on accidents.

Filters and slicers for custom exploration.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
